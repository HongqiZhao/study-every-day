### cd
    DOCUMENT:
    
    cd [-L|[-P [-e]]] [dir]

    Change the shell working directory.
    
    Change the current directory to DIR.  The default DIR is the value of the
    HOME shell variable.

    The variable CDPATH defines the search path for the directory containing
    DIR.  Alternative directory names in CDPATH are separated by a colon (:).
    A null directory name is the same as the current directory.  If DIR begins
    with a slash (/), then CDPATH is not used.

    If the directory is not found, and the shell option `cdable_vars' is set,
    the word is assumed to be  a variable name.  If that variable has a value,
    its value is used for DIR.

    Options:
        -L	force symbolic links to be followed
        -P	use the physical directory structure without following symbolic
    	links
        -e	if the -P option is supplied, and the current working directory
    	cannot be determined successfully, exit with a non-zero status

    The default is to follow symbolic links, as if `-L' were specified.

    Exit Status:
    Returns 0 if the directory is changed, and if $PWD is set successfully when
    -P is used; non-zero otherwise.

OPTIONS: 

- `-L` 强制跟到符号链接的目录
- `-P` 不跟随符号链接的目录，直接指向符号链接代表的物理目录
- `-e` 如果加上了"-P"选项，但是无法成功决定当前工作目录，以非零状态退出。（!）

一般默认跟的是`-L`

INSTANCES:

- cd .
- cd ..
- cd ~
- cd - 当仅实用"-"一个选项时，当前工作目录将被切换到环境变量"OLDPWD"所表示的目录。
